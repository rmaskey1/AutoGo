## About the Project

AutoGo is a web-based mock car rental website that emulates the experience of renting a car with ease. Users can rent, cancel, and return their cars all from their own account. This project is designed to replicate the simplicity and user friendliness of popular car rental services.

### Built With

List of the technologies/frameworks/languages used in the project. You can also include any major libraries that were used.

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL

## Getting Started

As of now, there is no releaseable version of this website. Though we plan on making a deployable version of the website, for the time being, the website will only be able to run locally.

### Prerequisites

Below are the necessary prerequisites in order to run the website locally:

- XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) version 8.0.28 or higher
- VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) version 1.78.1 or higher

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install the project.

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/SJSU-CMPE133-2023-Spring/AutoGo.git>
   ```

2. Install dependencies

- Install and run XAMPP.
  - Press the "start" button on the Apache and MySQL servers.
- Initialize the database
- Install and Run VSCode (or any other IDE)
- Create a folder called "AutoGo" with all of the files from our repository and place it in the xampp/htdocs folder
  - To access the homepage, type "localhost/AutoGo/homepage.php" into the address bar of your browser
- From here, you should be able to fully navigate the website

### Usage

AutoGo Features:
- Login/Signup
- Choose pick-up and drop-off locations with map view
- Choose start and end date of rental
- Choose a car
- Choose an insurance option
- Add payment information and confirm the order
- Account information page
- Order information page
- Return car
- Cancel order
- Guest rental (renting without logging in)

Once the user enters the website, they are free to navigate through the webpages however they'd like.

### Roadmap

The following improvements below will make AutoGo more accurate to existing car rental service websites as well as improve the user's experience while navigating the website:

- Car Sorting Filters: In the future, we plan on adding filter to sort cars based on a certain criterion, such as sort by price, number of seats, miles/gallon, etc.
- Email Invoice: We plan on developing an email invoice system for guest users who cannot track their orders through the website. Sending an email invoice to those users will allow them to confirm their order and cancel/return their car through a different method.
- Interactive Map: As of now, the map view of our locations is not interactive. In the future, we plan on adding functionality to the map by letting users choose their pick-up and drop-off location by clicking on the location markers on the map.
